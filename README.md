# projectsShowcase

This project is a method for showing my projects as a porfolio webpage. It was developed by hand, using a Bootstrap framework. 

Features:

- clean flat design
- six bootstrap cards with image links to project sites
- modals that come from these cards to give more deatils, and link to live sites.

TO run: download all files and open index.html in a browser.
